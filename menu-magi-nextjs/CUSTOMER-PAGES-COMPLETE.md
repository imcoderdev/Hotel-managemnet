## 🚨 KNOWN ISSUES (If Any)

### Issue 1: Payment Status Constraint
**Error:** `"new row violates check constraint orders_payment_status_check"`
**Cause:** Database constraint mismatch
**Fix:** Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check current constraint
SELECT constraint_name, check_clause
FROM information_schema.check_constraints
WHERE constraint_name LIKE '%payment%';

-- If it only allows 'pending', 'paid', 'failed', you're good!
-- The code now uses 'paid' which should work.
```
