## 💰 REVENUE POTENTIAL

### Year 1 Targets:
```
Subscriptions:    500 × $49 avg = $24,500/mo = $294K/yr
Payment Fees:     100 × $1,250  = $125K/mo  = $1.5M/yr
Total Year 1:                               = $1.79M ARR
```

### Path to $10M ARR:
- **Year 1:** $2M (500 customers, payments launch)
- **Year 2:** $5M (1,500 customers, enterprise tier)
- **Year 3:** $10M (3,000 customers, international)

## ⚠️ BIGGEST RISKS

### Risk 1: Can't Acquire Customers (Mitigation: Product-led growth)
- Build free tier that's genuinely useful
- Viral QR code sharing
- Restaurant owner referral program

### Risk 2: High Churn (Mitigation: Exceptional onboarding)
- White-glove setup for first 100 customers
- Video tutorials
- 24/7 chat support
- Monthly check-ins

### Risk 3: Toast/Square Competition (Mitigation: Niche focus)
- Target small restaurants (1-5 locations)
- They can't compete on price or speed
- Focus on delightful UX

---

## 🎯 FUNDING STRATEGY

### Bootstrap First (Recommended):
- $0 raised → $100K ARR: Self-funded
- $100K → $500K ARR: Maybe angel round ($250K)
- $500K → $2M ARR: Seed round ($2M @ $10M valuation)

### Why Bootstrap:
- You're already profitable at $50K MRR
- Keep 100% equity longer
- Forces discipline and focus
- Better valuation when you do raise

## 💡 THE VISION (5 Years Out)

**What you're building:**
> "The Shopify for Restaurants"

**Platform includes:**
- 🍔 Menu management (you have this)
- 💳 Payment processing (add this month)
- 📊 Analytics & insights (month 2)
- 📱 Customer app (month 4)
- 🔌 API & integrations (month 6)
- 🏪 Marketplace for plugins (year 2)
- 🌍 Multi-location chains (year 2)
- 🤝 White-label reselling (year 3)

**Exit scenarios:**
- $50M ARR → $500M+ acquisition by Toast/Square
- $100M ARR → IPO potential
- Keep building → $1B+ company

---

## ✅ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before scaling, validate:
- [ ] 10 restaurants paying $29+/mo (product-market fit)
- [ ] <5% monthly churn (retention)
- [ ] Customers refer other restaurants (viral growth)
- [ ] Positive unit economics (LTV > 3x CAC)
- [ ] Clear path to $1M ARR (scalability)

**Once you hit these, pour gas on the fire! 🔥**

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS TO AVOID

1. ❌ Building features customers don't want
2. ❌ Spending on ads before product-market fit
3. ❌ Hiring too early (wait until $10K MRR)
4. ❌ Copying competitors (be different!)
5. ❌ Ignoring customer feedback (talk to them weekly)

---

## 🎯 THE BOTTOM LINE

**You have:** Solid MVP, modern stack, clear market need  
**You need:** Revenue model, customers, validation  
**Timeline:** 6-12 months to $1M ARR is realistic  
**Investment needed:** $0-$50K (can bootstrap)  
**Probability of success:** 40% (high for startups!)  

**Next action:** Choose 1 restaurant. Make them love you. Then find 9 more. Everything else is noise.

**Go build! 🚀**
