# 🎉 Authentication Fixed - Update

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **Issue:**
- After signup, login was giving an error
- Owner record wasn't being created automatically
- Google OAuth redirect wasn't working properly

### **Solution:**
Created a complete signup/login flow with automatic owner record creation.

---

## 🔐 New Authentication Flow

### **1. Email/Password Signup & Login**

**Features:**
- ✅ Toggle between Login and Signup on same page
- ✅ Automatic owner record creation
- ✅ Restaurant name field during signup
- ✅ Password validation (min 6 characters)
- ✅ Email verification support
- ✅ Auto-login after successful signup

**Login Page:** http://localhost:3000/owner/login

---

### **2. Google OAuth**

**Features:**
- ✅ One-click Google login/signup
- ✅ Automatic owner record creation
- ✅ Uses user's name as restaurant name
- ✅ Proper callback handling

**Callback Route:** `/auth/callback` (handles OAuth redirect)

---

## 📝 How It Works Now

### **Signup Flow:**

```
User clicks "Sign up" on login page
    ↓
Fills in:
- Restaurant Name (e.g., "Pizza Palace")
- Email (e.g., "owner@pizza.com")
- Password (min 6 chars)
    ↓
Clicks "Create Account"
    ↓
System does:
1. Creates Supabase Auth user
2. Creates owner record in database:
   - id: user's UUID
   - email: user's email
   - restaurant_name: entered name
    ↓
Auto-login and redirect to dashboard
```

---

### **Login Flow:**

```
User enters email & password
    ↓
Clicks "Sign In"
    ↓
System does:
1. Authenticates with Supabase
2. Checks if owner record exists
3. If not, creates one (safety fallback)
    ↓
Redirect to dashboard
```

---

### **Google OAuth Flow:**

```
User clicks "Sign up with Google"
    ↓
Google login popup
    ↓
Redirects to /auth/callback
    ↓
Callback handler:
1. Exchanges code for session
2. Checks if owner record exists
3. If not, creates owner with:
   - id: user's UUID
   - email: Google email
   - restaurant_name: Google name or "My Restaurant"
    ↓
Redirect to dashboard
```

## 💡 Tips

### **Supabase Email Confirmation:**

By default, Supabase requires email confirmation. To disable:
1. Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
2. Scroll to "Email Confirmations"
3. Disable "Enable email confirmations"
4. Users can login immediately after signup

### **Google OAuth Setup:**

If Google login not working:
1. Check `.env.local` has correct Client ID and Secret
2. Verify authorized redirect URIs in Google Console:
   - http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   - https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
3. Enable Google provider in Supabase Dashboard

**Authentication is now fully working! Test it and let me know if you want to build the next feature! 🎉**
