## 📧 Cold Email Template

**Subject:** Cut your ordering costs by 80% - QR menu for {{Restaurant Name}}

Hi {{Name}},

I noticed {{Restaurant Name}} is still using {{competitor/paper menus}}.

We built Menu Magi to help restaurants like yours:
- Accept orders via QR code (no app download)
- Manage menu from your phone
- Track every order in real-time

**The best part?** $29/month (vs Toast's $69+hardware).

Would you have 15 minutes this week for a quick demo?

Best,
{{Your Name}}
{{Your Phone}}

P.S. First 50 restaurants get 50% off for life ($14.50/mo)

## 🗣️ Objection Handling

**"We already use Toast/Square"**
→ "Great! How's the mobile experience? Our customers love that they can manage menus from their phone in 30 seconds."

**"Too expensive"**
→ "Compared to what? Toast is $69/mo. We're $29. Plus we waive the setup fee for you."

**"Not now, maybe later"**
→ "I get it. Can I add you to our newsletter? We share tips on increasing orders by 30%+ using QR codes."

**"Need to think about it"**
→ "What specifically are you concerned about? I can answer that right now."

**"Already have a website"**
→ "Perfect! Menu Magi is better than a website because customers don't need to download anything. They scan, order, done."

## 🎓 Daily Routine (While Building)

### Morning (2 hours):

- Respond to customer messages
- Ship 1 small feature or bug fix

- Customer calls/demos (2-3 per day)
- Email outreach (20 emails)

## 🚨 When to Quit Your Day Job

**Wait until you hit these milestones:**
1. ✅ $5,000 MRR (covers living expenses)
2. ✅ <3% monthly churn (customers staying)
3. ✅ 3 months of runway saved
4. ✅ Clear path to $10K MRR (repeatable growth)

**Don't quit based on:**
- ❌ One big customer (could churn)
- ❌ Excitement/hype (not sustainable)
- ❌ Fundraising (money runs out)

2. **>10% monthly churn** → Product is broken or wrong market
3. **CAC > LTV** → Can't grow profitably
4. **No word-of-mouth** → Product isn't remarkable
5. **You hate talking to customers** → Wrong business for you

## 📞 Emergency Contacts

**If you get stuck:**
1. Post in Indie Hackers (fastest help)
2. Twitter DM successful SaaS founders
3. Join MicroConf Slack
4. r/SaaS subreddit
5. Your customer (ask them!)

**Mental health:**
- Startup is a marathon, not sprint
- Take weekends off
- Exercise daily
- Sleep 7-8 hours
- Talk to other founders (reduces loneliness)

---

## 🎯 The One Thing

**If you only do ONE thing this month:**

> **Get 1 restaurant to pay you $29.**

Everything else is noise. One paying customer validates:
- ✅ Product solves real problem
- ✅ Pricing is acceptable
- ✅ You can acquire customers
- ✅ Business model works

**Once you have 1, get to 10. Once you have 10, get to 100.**

That's it. That's the game. 

**Now go execute! 🚀**
