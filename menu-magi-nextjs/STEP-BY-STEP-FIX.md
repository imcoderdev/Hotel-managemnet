# üéØ EXACT STEPS TO FIX ORDERS NOT SHOWING

```
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of diagnose-order-visibility.sql
4. Paste and click "Run"
5. Look at results - it will show you what's missing
```

```
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of COMPLETE-RLS-FIX.sql
4. Paste and click "Run"
5. Wait for success message
```

## üö® IMPORTANT: Only Run These 2 Files

1. `COMPLETE-RLS-FIX.sql` - **REQUIRED** (fixes everything)
2. `diagnose-order-visibility.sql` - **OPTIONAL** (just for checking)

### ‚ùå Files to NOT run (they're old/redundant):
- ~~`fix-orders-rls.sql`~~ (superseded by COMPLETE-RLS-FIX.sql)
- ~~`fix-storage-rls.sql`~~ (superseded by COMPLETE-RLS-FIX.sql)

4. Click: **New Query**

## üîç If Orders Still Don't Show After Running SQL:

### Check 1: Did the SQL script succeed?
Look for this in Supabase:
```
‚úÖ INSERT 0 1 (bucket created)
‚úÖ CREATE POLICY (should see multiple times)
‚úÖ ALTER TABLE (RLS enabled)
```

### Check 2: Are you logged in as the owner?
```
1. Check your email in profile
2. Must be same email used when creating restaurant
```

### Check 3: Does the order have the correct owner_id?
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT id, order_number, owner_id, total, status, created_at
FROM orders
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Compare `owner_id` with your user ID:
```sql
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users;
```

They should match!
