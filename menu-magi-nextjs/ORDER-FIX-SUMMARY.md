# ✅ FIXED: Orders Now Showing in Owner Dashboard

## 🐛 What Was Wrong

**Problem:** After customer clicked "Confirm & Pay", orders were NOT appearing in owner's orders page.

**Root Cause:** The `ownerId` was not being set properly in the customer flow:
1. QR code has `?restaurant=OWNER_ID`
2. Table page stored it as `restaurantId` 
3. Menu page tried to get `ownerId` from menu items
4. **BUT**: If no menu items, `ownerId` was NEVER set!
5. Checkout couldn't create order without `ownerId`

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. Menu Page - Set Owner ID Immediately
**Before:** Only set `ownerId` after loading menu items (failed if no items)
**Now:** Set `ownerId` from `restaurantId` IMMEDIATELY when page loads

```typescript
// ✅ Set ownerId right away if restaurantId exists
if (ownerId) {
  sessionStorage.setItem('ownerId', ownerId);
}
```

### 2. Checkout Page - Fallback to Restaurant ID
**Before:** Only used `ownerId` from sessionStorage
**Now:** Use `restaurantId` as fallback if `ownerId` is missing

```typescript
// ✅ Use restaurantId as backup
const finalOwnerId = storedOwnerId || storedRestaurantId;

if (!finalOwnerId) {
  toast.error('Restaurant info missing. Please scan QR code again.');
  return;
}
```

### 3. Better Error Messages
**Before:** Generic "Missing order information" error
**Now:** Shows exactly what's missing: "Missing: restaurant ID"

### 4. Added Debug Logging
- Menu page logs when `ownerId` is set
- Checkout logs all sessionStorage values
- Owner orders page logs query results

## 🧪 How to Test

### Quick Test (5 minutes):

1. **Owner Login:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/owner/login
   - Login as owner
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Click "QR Code" button
   - Copy the URL (like: `http://localhost:3000/customer/table?restaurant=abc123`)

2. **Customer Order (in incognito window):**
   - Open incognito window
   - Paste the QR code URL
   - Select table
   - Add items to cart
   - Go to checkout
   - Click "Confirm & Pay"

3. **Check Owner Dashboard:**
   - Go back to owner's browser
   - Click "Orders" in header
   - **You should now see the order!** ✅

## 🔍 Debug Console Logs

### What You'll See (Success):

**Menu Page:**
```
✅ Set ownerId from restaurantId: abc123xyz
```

**Checkout Page:**
```
🔍 Checkout - sessionStorage values: {
  tableNumber: "5",
  ownerId: "abc123xyz",
  restaurantId: "abc123xyz"
}
✅ Checkout initialized with ownerId: abc123xyz
✅ Starting order creation with: {...}
✅ Order created successfully!
```

**Owner Orders Page:**
```
🔍 Loading orders for owner: abc123xyz
✅ Loaded orders: 1 orders
```

## ⚠️ If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check These:

1. **Owner ID Mismatch:**
   - Check console: Does customer's `ownerId` match owner's `session.user.id`?
   - They should be EXACTLY the same

2. **Database Issues:**
   - Run `quick-fix-gst-columns.sql` in Supabase if you see "column gst_amount does not exist"
   - Check if orders table has `owner_id` column

3. **RLS Policies:**
   - Owner might not have permission to read orders
   - Check Supabase RLS policies for `orders` table

---

## 📋 Files Changed

1. ✅ `app/customer/menu/page.tsx` - Set ownerId immediately
2. ✅ `app/customer/checkout/page.tsx` - Fallback to restaurantId
3. ✅ `app/owner/orders/page.tsx` - Added debug logs

**No database changes needed!** This was a frontend state issue.

---

## 🎯 Complete Flow (Now Working)

```
1. Owner generates QR: ?restaurant=OWNER_123
2. Customer scans → Table select
3. ✅ restaurantId saved: "OWNER_123"
4. Customer picks table 5
5. ✅ tableNumber saved: "5"
6. Menu loads
7. ✅ ownerId set from restaurantId: "OWNER_123"
8. Customer adds items → Checkout
9. ✅ Order created with owner_id: "OWNER_123"
10. Owner opens Orders page
11. ✅ Query: owner_id = "OWNER_123"
12. ✅ Order appears! Table 5, Status: Waiting
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

**Order is visible when:**
- ✅ Customer sees "Payment successful! Order placed."
- ✅ Console shows "✅ Order created successfully!"
- ✅ Owner's orders page shows "1 active orders"
- ✅ Order card displays with table number
- ✅ Status shows "⏳ Waiting"
- ✅ "Accept Order" button appears

**Now test it! Open the owner dashboard in one window, and place an order from customer side in incognito. The order should appear immediately!** 🎉
